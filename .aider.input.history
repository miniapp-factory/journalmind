+Code the following app
+```
+5. JournalMind
+Idea: A trading journal focused on psychology: not just numbers, but also emotions and decisions.
+User goal: Understand personal mistakes and emotional patterns in trading.
+Core features (MVP):
+
+* Manual trade entry: pair, direction, entry, exit, result.
+* Fields for:
+
+emotions before/after the trade,
+reason for entry,
+rule violations (yes/no, which ones).
+
+
+* Simple stats:
+
+PnL over a period,
+trades by emotional state,
+most frequent mistakes.
+
+
+* Tags for trades (e.g., “impulsive”, “by plan”, “FOMO”).
+
+Development plan:
+
+1. Design a simple database: trades, tags, notes.
+2. Implement UI forms for creating/editing trades.
+3. Add filters: by date, pair, tags, emotions.
+4. Create basic analytics blocks (frequency tables, summaries).
+5. Implement export to CSV/Google Sheets.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
